I wanted a place to keep my art and projects together — somewhere I can point people when I casually say “oh, by the way, I do art” or “by the way, I use Arch”.
There’s no “like” button here, no comment section, no algorithm. Just a place to look at what I do.

I used Instagram for a while, but left for many reasons. The final straw was watching the platform slide into fascist territory. Even before that, I realized I was consuming more than I was creating. And when I did create, I had this nagging thought in the back of my mind: will this perform well?

Now, I just create.
With this site, I can upload older works and keep the creative process completely separate from the act of posting. No pressure to “perform” — just making and sharing.

And if, by some miracle, someone finds my work good enough to buy, there’s always the old-school way to get in touch: email.
